Style Guidelines
----------------

For all things regarding whitespace, run code through uncrustify using

```shell
uncrustify -c style.cfg -f <source_file>
```

and refer to style.cfg for specifications.


Naming Conventions
==================

Use lowercase underscore (snake_case) for both function names and variable names.

For preprocessor constants defines, use all uppercase letters, with
underscores between words.
